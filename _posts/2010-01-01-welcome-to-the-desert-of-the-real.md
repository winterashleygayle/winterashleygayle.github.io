Photographed inside an old barn in rural Oregon, this image reflects the meeting place between memory and possibility. The worn wood, empty chairs, and fading light speak to the passage of time — a reminder that every doorway opens to both what we’ve lived and what remains ahead. It is part of a continuing series exploring memory, place, and human nature in rural landscapes.
