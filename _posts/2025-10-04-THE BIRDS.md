Birds are reminders of movement, migration, and perspective. They exist between worlds, grounded yet capable of flight, carrying instinct older than language. Their presence marks seasons, signals change, and reflects the health of the landscapes we inhabit. To notice birds is to pay attention to balance, fragility, and continuity, to the quiet intelligence of nature still moving alongside us.
