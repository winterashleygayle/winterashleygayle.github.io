Liminality is the state of being in between—between what was and what will be, between identities, roles, or worlds.

The word comes from the Latin limen, meaning threshold.

You are no longer who you were.
You are not yet who you are becoming.
And you are standing in the doorway.

In simple terms

Liminality is:

the hallway, not the room

the pause, not the decision

the cocoon, not the butterfly

It’s uncomfortable because the old rules no longer work, and the new ones haven’t arrived yet.

In psychology & anthropology

Liminality was first described in rites of passage:

adolescence

initiation

grief

illness

spiritual awakening

divorce

identity collapse

deep healing

During liminal phases:

certainty dissolves

identity loosens

time feels strange

emotions are intensified

meaning becomes fluid

This is why people in liminality often feel:

ungrounded

raw

hyper-aware

exhausted

strangely creative

deeply intuitive

Nothing is wrong with them.
They are between skins.

In spiritual / shamanic terms

Liminality is the initiatory space.

It’s where:

ego structures break down

the old story dies

symbols, dreams, and synchronicities increase

guides, archetypes, and animal symbols appear

Shamans, mystics, and artists are often shaped here.

Not by comfort.
By surrender.

Why it feels so intense

Liminal spaces strip away:

roles

masks

scripts

social performance

You can’t rely on who you used to be, and you can’t yet stand fully in who you’re becoming.

So the nervous system panics.
The mind grasps.
The soul listens.

Modern liminality (why so many feel it now)

We are collectively in liminality:

old systems failing

identities politicized

truth blurred by performance

social media simulating connection

grief normalized but not metabolized

We are between eras.

That’s why liminal language resonates so deeply right now—it names what people feel but can’t locate.

The secret of liminality

Liminality is not meant to be solved.

It is meant to be:

honored

witnessed

endured

integrated

If you rush it, you fragment.
If you avoid it, you repeat it.
If you stay conscious inside it, you transform.

A simple way to recognize you’re in liminality

You may notice:

a pull toward silence

intolerance for superficiality

shedding relationships or identities

vivid dreams

grief without a clear cause

a sense of being “between lives”

That’s the threshold speaking.

The gift

Liminality is where:

meaning reorganizes

truth re-emerges

integrity is forged

power is reclaimed quietly

It is the place before the becoming.

And though it feels like groundlessness,
it is actually the most fertile ground there is.
