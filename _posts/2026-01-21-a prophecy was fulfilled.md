## Witness


<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

If the skull could talk, it would speak softly.


It would say:

I remember when I was moving.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

Not in a hurry.
Not trying to be anything other than what the day asked of me.

The land carried me then, and I carried it back.
We understood each other without language.

Now I sit here, resting.
Watching you pass through the room with full hands and busy minds.
You look at me sometimes, and I feel the pause in your breath.
That pause is enough.

I don’t mind the chair.
It’s sturdy. It knows patience.
All things that last learn how to wait.

What I miss is not the body.
It’s the rhythm.

The way tending happened without effort.
The way care was woven into movement.
The way nothing sacred needed to be named because it was already being lived.

If you’re wondering what I hold, it isn’t answers.
It’s memory.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
I am here to remind you that life was never meant to be rushed past or preserved in symbols alone.
That what matters still grows quietly, asking only for attention.
That returning to the simple acts—watering, listening, resting—has always been enough.

You don’t need to understand me.
You don’t need to interpret me.

Just remember to touch the earth before the day ends.
Remember to tend what depends on you.
Remember that nothing meaningful asks for spectacle.

I will stay here.
You don’t have to.
