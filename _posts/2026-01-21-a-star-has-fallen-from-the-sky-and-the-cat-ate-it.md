## I will not let you settle for a shallow version of peace when your soul is capable of something more honest, more alive, more whole. 





The dark night of the soul is a period of deep inner unknowing where old beliefs, identities, and sources of comfort fall away, but nothing new has fully taken their place yet. To truly find ourselves, we have to turn inward. Not outward. Not toward ideology or borrowed certainty. Inward.



That is where life subtly diverges from the loud and increasingly rigid Christian conservative movement dominating public discourse right now. What we are seeing culturally is not faith, but dogma. Rhetoric without humility. Belief without inner work. Religion, when stripped of lived experience and compassion, becomes brittle. It stops transforming people and starts organizing them.



What has proven far more sustaining for many, myself included, is the exploration of Christ consciousness rather than institutional religion. Christ consciousness is not about rules or moral superiority. It is about embodied love, inner awakening, compassion forged through suffering, and a direct relationship with the divine. The path to it is not tidy.



When you begin real spiritual work and take that deep dive within, it often opens doors in the psyche that most people actively avoid. Especially if your life includes profound loss, trauma, or abuse, the inward path does not lead to bliss first. It leads to grief, memory, fear, and the long task of learning how to sit with what hurt you without abandoning yourself.



That is why this road is not popular. It is not aspirational in a shallow sense. It is demanding. It requires you to find comfort where none was given and to build inner safety where it was once violated. But that is also where the gold is.



Paramahansa Yogananda once said that it is very, very, very good karma to even want to know God. That desire alone marks a soul that has already begun the journey. Not everyone wants that, and that is okay. This path is not meant to be universal. It is meant to be honest.



There is a saying that the only way out is through, and nowhere is that truer than in healing trauma. Many who identify as empaths discover that their initiation into deeper awareness comes through narcissistic abuse. It is a brutal rite of passage, but surviving it strips illusions away. It teaches discernment, boundaries, and self trust. For many, it cracks the heart open into something deeply spiritual.



This kind of growth is not especially practical for people content with surface level living. It does not optimize productivity or offer simple answers. Those who walk it often live on the fringe, between worlds, belief systems, and identities. But that fringe is becoming more populated.



Whether people want to acknowledge it or not, the world is shifting politically, socially, and spiritually. Even those who reject introspection can feel it. Something bigger is happening. Old structures are straining. Certainties are eroding. In times like these, turning inward is not escapism. It is preparation.



Finding your own light is not a gentle process. It costs blood, sweat, tears, and time. But it returns something no ideology ever can: inner authority, compassion rooted in truth, and a sense of meaning that does not collapse when the outer world does.
