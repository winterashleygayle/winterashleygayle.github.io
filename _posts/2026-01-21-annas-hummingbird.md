A small shamanic story about an Anna’s hummingbird 🌸

There is a story some people tell, not from books, but from listening.

Once, during a long dry season, a woman sat very still in her garden. She had been carrying grief quietly, the kind that makes the world feel heavier than it looks. She wasn’t asking for answers, only for a moment of ease.

An Anna’s hummingbird appeared and hovered in front of her face, so close she could hear the soft whirr of its wings. It didn’t rush. It didn’t flee. It simply stayed, suspended between effort and grace.

The bird darted to a flower, then returned to hover again, as if to say:

### “I burn more energy than almost any creature alive, and still, I choose sweetness.”

The woman noticed how the bird’s pink throat flashed only when it caught the light at just the right angle. Not always visible. Not forced. Beauty revealed by presence, not striving.

Then the hummingbird flew straight up, impossibly high, and vanished into the sky.

Later, the woman understood the message:
Joy does not come from ease.
Joy comes from choosing nectar, even when the work of living is intense.

And from that day on, whenever she felt overwhelmed, she remembered the Anna’s hummingbird, heart blazing, wings humming, trusting that there would be another flower. 🌸.
