## The Day the Music Died

My brother did not die quietly in the sense people mean when they try to soften the truth. His death was loud in its aftermath, destabilizing in ways that rippled through everything that came after. The circumstances were complicated, contested, and heavy with unanswered questions. What mattered most, though, was not the speculation. It was the rupture.

The day he died, something essential went missing from our family system.

Music is the only word I have for it.

Not because he was always playing it, though he often was, but because he carried a kind of rhythm with him. A presence. An emotional register that held humor, chaos, intelligence, and intensity all at once. When he left, that rhythm stopped. Everything after moved out of time.

His death was not absorbed. It detonated.

Grief did not move through us cleanly or collectively. It fractured us further. It pulled at already weakened seams. It activated denial, blame, silence, and retreat. No one knew where to place the weight of what had happened, so it dispersed unevenly. Some collapsed inward. Some hardened. Some disappeared. No one knew how to metabolize it.

My mother did not survive that loss in any meaningful psychological sense. Whatever stability she had been holding onto gave way. Her grief was total, consuming, and unintegrated. She could not look directly at what had happened, and she could not look at herself within it. The loss hollowed her out.

My siblings and I were left to navigate the aftermath without a shared language for what had occurred. There was no container. No clear reckoning. Just a silence that grew heavier with time.

For me, his death marked the moment when confusion became the organizing principle of the family. Nothing made sense anymore, and no one was explaining anything. Questions were treated as threats. Clarity felt dangerous. Grief was something to survive rather than face.

In the years that followed, his absence shaped everything. It accelerated patterns that were already present and pushed fragile systems past their breaking point. Addiction deepened. Mental health deteriorated. The gravitational pull toward destruction intensified.

This is why I say the devil took my family.

Not because my brother was weak. Not because he failed. But because his death removed a stabilizing force, and what rushed in afterward found no resistance.

His death was not an ending. It was an opening.

An opening that swallowed everything that came after.
