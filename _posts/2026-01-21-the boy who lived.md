There is more to say about my brother, and I will say it when the time is right. For now, this is the part that cannot be skipped.

## The Day the Music Died

My brother did not die quietly in the sense people mean when they try to soften the truth. His death was loud in its aftermath, destabilizing in ways that rippled through everything that came after. The circumstances were complicated, contested, and heavy with unanswered questions. What mattered most, though, was not the speculation. It was the rupture.

What I did not expect was that he did not disappear.

In the days after his death, he began to show up in a way I did not understand and did not trust. Not as a ghost. Not as a vision. But as a presence in my inner world. A voice that felt familiar, steady, and oddly practical. He appeared at moments when I was stuck, overwhelmed, or unable to decide what to do next.

For more than a decade, I refused to believe this meant anything beyond grief.

I told myself I had made him up. That my mind, shattered by loss, had created an imaginary guide to cope with the absence. That this was what trauma did. It filled the silence with invention. I was convinced that if I acknowledged him as anything more, I would be admitting that I had lost my grip on reality.

So I argued with myself instead.

But he stayed.

Not constantly. Not intrusively. He appeared when I was at an impasse. When the next step was unclear. When I was alone in decisions no one else could make for me. He did not comfort me in the way people expect grief to comfort. He oriented me. He cut through confusion. He told me things I did not want to hear and could not yet understand.

A few days after he died, still unconvinced he was anything more than my imagination, I gave in for a moment and played along. I asked him a question I had been carrying.

Why aren’t you with Crysta and Mom? They are beside themselves. I’m fine. Why are you here?

His response was immediate. Clear. Unambiguous.

Because you need me more.

At the time, I rejected it. It felt wrong. Even cruel. I could not imagine a world in which I was the one who needed him most. I pushed the thought away and returned to my explanation. This is grief. This is coping. This is invention.

It took years to understand what he meant.

I was headed into many dark nights of the soul. Years that would require dismantling inherited patterns, surviving the collapse of my family system, and learning how to stay conscious while everything familiar fell away. I would become the one who did not numb, did not disappear, did not exit through the same doors the others did.

I would become the cycle breaker.

In psychological terms, he may have lived on as an internalized attachment figure, a stabilizing presence formed through loss. In spiritual terms, he felt like a guide. In truth, both can exist at once. The mind does not invent what it does not need. And what I needed was orientation. Continuity. A tether to something steady when everything else was breaking.

He was not there to save me.

He was there to help me reclaim myself.

Only later did I understand that his presence was not about death. It was about survival. About remaining intact through experiences that would otherwise fracture the soul. He knew, in a way I could not yet know, that the road ahead would require endurance rather than escape.

And he stayed.
