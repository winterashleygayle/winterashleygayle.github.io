## 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐆𝐢𝐫𝐥 𝐖𝐡𝐨 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐭𝐨 𝐑𝐨𝐜𝐤 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐨𝐫𝐥𝐝

There was once a little girl who learned very early that the world was not always safe.

She didn’t have words for it yet. She didn’t understand why her body stayed tight or why her breath caught when footsteps came too close. She only knew that something inside her needed soothing, something ancient and instinctual, something older than language.

So she rocked.

At first, she did it without knowing she was doing it. On the floor. On her side. One arm tucked beneath her body, the other crossing her chest like a quiet vow of protection. Music would play, or sometimes just the hum of the room, and she would move back and forth, back and forth, as if she were rocking the world itself into calm.

No one taught her this.
Her nervous system did.

Children who grow up inside safety learn comfort from others. Children who grow up inside chaos learn it from themselves.

This little girl learned how to survive.

She learned how to leave her body without leaving it. How to imagine a life where she was loved, seen, and chosen. Sometimes the fantasies were small, being liked at school, being included, being normal. Sometimes they were big, freedom, peace, a future that felt like sunlight instead of shadows.

And the rocking worked.

It regulated what no one else could regulate for her. It gave her control where there was none. It was her first language of self care. Her first medicine. Her first spell.

She carried that rhythm with her as she grew.

Years passed. The world saw her walking upright, functioning, surviving. But the little girl was still there, still rocking when things became too much. Still returning to the one place where she knew she would be held, by herself.

Some people might call that strange.
Some people call that autism.
Some might call it a habit.
Some might misunderstand it entirely.

But trauma doesn’t care what we call it.
Trauma only asks one question:
Did you survive?

She did.

She rocked through childhood. Through adolescence. Through relationships that echoed the chaos she once knew. Through losses, betrayals, confusion, and long nights where the past knocked loudly on the present.

She rocked until she was 29 years old.

Not because she was weak, but because she was resourceful.

One day, much later, something shifted. Not suddenly. Not dramatically. Just quietly. She realized she didn’t need to leave herself anymore. The body that once needed rhythm to feel safe had learned new ways to settle. New ways to breathe. New ways to stay.

The rocking didn’t disappear because it was wrong.
It faded because its job was done.

And here’s the part most people miss:
That little girl didn’t need rescuing.
She was the rescuer.

She became her own superhero without a cape, without applause, without anyone noticing. Her superpower wasn’t strength or speed. It was adaptation. It was intuition. It was the ability to create safety from nothing.

She didn’t survive despite her coping mechanisms.
She survived because of them.

And now, when she looks back, she doesn’t see shame.

She sees wisdom.

She sees a child who refused to disappear.
A child who soothed herself when no one else could.
A child who rocked herself into existence again and again.

Some superheroes fly.
Some bend steel.
Some save cities.

This one learned how to rock herself through hell and lived to talk about it.

### There is still so much shame attached to how people survive childhood trauma. Coping mechanisms are often misunderstood, judged, or pathologized, especially when they don’t look neat or socially acceptable. But these behaviors are not flaws. They are adaptations.

When a child grows up without safety, their nervous system learns to create it however it can. Rocking, dissociation, daydreaming, hyper independence, people pleasing, emotional numbing, and withdrawal are not signs of weakness. They are signs of intelligence and resilience. They are the body and mind working together to protect life.

Shame silences this truth. It teaches survivors to hide the very tools that helped them endure. It turns survival into something to be embarrassed by rather than honored. Breaking that stigma matters because healing cannot happen in secrecy or self rejection. Healing begins when we understand that coping mechanisms are not who someone is. They are what someone needed.

When we shift the narrative from “What’s wrong with you?” to “What helped you survive?” we create space for compassion, integration, and real recovery. Naming these experiences with respect helps survivors reclaim their story without being defined by their trauma.

Ending the shame around coping mechanisms doesn’t glorify trauma. It restores dignity to those who lived through it.
