# My Spirit Helper 
### The Girl in the Lighthouse

Long ago, before I had language for it, there was a journey.

It took place to the rhythm of a drum, that steady heartbeat that loosens time and opens the thin veil between worlds. A woman named Anna guided the journey then. She no longer practices Shamanism, and I do not know where life carried her, but in that moment she was exactly who she needed to be: a witness, a holder of the doorway. I hope she is well.

In that journey, she followed me, but not as I am now. She followed my twelve-year-old self.

The girl ran barefoot along a beach, wind in her hair, eyes fixed on a lighthouse ahead. She ran with urgency and excitement, convinced that something extraordinary waited at the top. An alien, perhaps. An angel. Some ethereal being from the universe who would finally give her all the answers.

She burst through the lighthouse door and climbed the spiral stairs two at a time, heart racing, imagination blazing. At the top, she stopped short.

There was no celestial being waiting for her.
There was only a man.

An ordinary-looking man. Steady. Familiar.
He was the lighthouse keeper.

As Anna described him, recognition landed in my body like a bell sounding in my chest. The man was my grandfather — not as I remembered him in photographs or family gatherings, but as something deeper. An ancestor in his proper element, tending the light.

He was carefully maintaining the lens, the intricate and fragile glass that fractures light into brilliance. He handled it with reverence, understanding that the lighthouse only works when every piece is honored, cleaned, and aligned. The light does not blaze by accident. It is crafted. Remembered. Passed down.

The girl felt disappointed. She had wanted the future, not the past. Technology, not history. She had never been particularly interested in what came before — only what was coming next.

He noticed.

Do not be so quick to dismiss history, he told her gently. Patterns matter. What came before you teaches you how to stand now.

What he was offering was not nostalgia. It was lineage — not only blood, but wisdom carried through generations. An understanding that spirit helpers do not always arrive as winged beings or visitors from the stars. Sometimes they arrive as ancestors who know the terrain because they walked it first.

Then he guided her outside, to the circular railing that wrapped the lighthouse.

Look, he said.
Below them, waves crashed against dark rocks.
You are never going to hit those, he told her calmly.
"You will never hit the rocks."

He turned then, not to the girl, but to Anna, the one witnessing and listening and answered the question forming in her mind.

Yes, he said. She is a lighthouse.
He gestured out to sea.

All those boats are other people, each on their own journey, each navigating storms, fog, and uncertainty.
The girl watched the distant lights bobbing on the water.

Your job is not to save them, he said. Not to chase them. Not to throw yourself into the sea.

He paused, letting the truth settle.
Your job is to stand where you are and shine.

Something clicked then. An old knowing resurfaced. The girl remembered words she had once read: Lighthouses do not run all over an island trying to rescue boats. They simply stand and shine.

She understood.
Guidance is not control. Help is not self-erasure. Presence is enough.

Some ships would come close. Some would pass by. Some would resent the light or mistake it for judgment. Some would turn away, because seeing clearly can be uncomfortable. Guides are not always loved. They are not always chosen. You will be rejected and often. Sometimes they are only recognized later, when the shore is finally reached.

The mission was simple, and it was not easy.
Shine. Reflect. Hold steady.
And so he has stayed with her.

Since his passing, he returns not as a voice that interrupts, but as a presence that reassures — a tap on the shoulder, a gentle pat on the head, a reminder at just the right moment.

In his waking life, he signed every birthday card the same way:

Glad you made it.

In spirit, the message remains.

He was not only glad she reached the top of the lighthouse that day.
He was glad she became it.
