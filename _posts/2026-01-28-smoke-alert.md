## My grandfather, along with his parents and siblings, fled Germany and came to the United States to escape the Nazi regime and avoid being pulled into its ideology. I have German roots in my own family, and they made a deliberate moral choice to reject Nazism and its rhetoric. They left everything behind to start over based on their values.

Our family name was originally Lobenstein. When my grandfather and his family fled Germany, they first dropped the “stein” in an effort to distance themselves from a country and ideology they were actively rejecting. Eventually, they chose to leave the name behind altogether and took his mother’s maiden name, Roberts. That decision was not about convenience. It was about conscience. It marked a clear break from a regime rooted in fascism, violence, and dehumanization.

Lobenstein is a Germanic Jewish Ashkenazi surname. During the late 1800s and especially the 1930s and 1940s, many families with German or Jewish surnames anglicized or altered their names after immigrating to the United States in order to avoid discrimination and political danger. In many cases, identifying suffixes such as “stein” were dropped due to rising antisemitism.

It’s also important to understand that Ashkenazi Jews were not aligned with German nationalism. In fact, they were frequently marginalized, restricted, and persecuted within German-speaking societies long before the Nazi era. By the time Nazism emerged, Ashkenazi Jews were among its primary targets. This is why many families with Germanic Jewish surnames fled, changed their names, or deliberately severed ties with anything that could associate them with Germany or its regime.

_________________________________

There is a persistent narrative among some right leaning and Republican leaning groups that immigrants are responsible for the majority of crime in the United States. That belief is not supported by the data. Multiple large scale studies over decades consistently show that immigrants both documented and undocumented commit violent crime at lower rates than native born citizens. Yet people are repeatedly fed inflated or distorted numbers through selective media framing, sound bites, and fear based messaging. Most Americans do not actually know the real statistics. They only know the version that gets the most attention.

At the same time, we are watching a very different kind of crime be minimized, deflected from, or outright obscured. The Jeffrey Epstein case long dismissed, downplayed, or treated as fringe conspiracy has been repeatedly validated through court records, settlements, and judicial actions calling for the release of documents. Even officials have acknowledged that the names involved would implicate powerful people and cause widespread damage. That alone should tell us something.

And let’s be honest. The people implicated in those records are not immigrants. They are overwhelmingly wealthy, well connected, and predominantly white men, many of whom held positions of power, influence, or public trust. We are talking about systemic abuse protected by money, status, and institutions, not crimes committed by people crossing borders to work, survive, or build a life.

Yet I hear my own family members say things like, “Immigrants are coming here raping and killing everyone,” while ignoring documented patterns of sexual violence committed by powerful insiders, violence that is quietly shielded, delayed, or buried. That contradiction should stop anyone in their tracks.

At some point, this is not even about politics. It is about basic logic, moral consistency, and values. If your outrage is aimed downward at the most vulnerable people while excusing or ignoring harm done by those at the top, then your outrage has been carefully engineered.

What makes this even harder to accept is the hypocrisy. Many of the same people who demonize immigrants have immigrants in their own families. Parents, grandparents, spouses, people who came here from other countries seeking safety, opportunity, or freedom. My own family includes immigrants. This country was built by them.

So when people turn against immigrants while benefiting from that same legacy, it is not just illogical. It is morally incoherent.

These are the conversations I choose not to engage in anymore. Not because they are uncomfortable, but because they require a willingness to confront truth over fear. And if someone is not willing to do that, especially when the facts, history, and their own family story are staring them in the face, then the issue is not ignorance.

It is choice.

Grandpa Dego (his nickname) had a phrase he used all the time with his daughters (my mother/aunts) and his grandkids. “Glad you made it.” He wrote it in birthday cards, and meant it as a quiet celebration of surviving another year. Lately, I’ve felt his presence again, like a gentle touch at the top of my head, and I can hear him saying it the same way he always did. “Glad you made it, kid.” Because of that, I choose to honor him. He lives on in spirit, and I feel his approval and support in the choices I’m making now. We are living in a moment defined by choice, and what we stand for, our morals and our values, truly matters.
