### Calm Your Tits

# Emotional Alchemy 
In the Major Arcana, Temperance comes after upheaval and before embodiment. It often appears when someone has already been through chaos, loss, or inner reckoning and is now learning how to live well with what they’ve survived.

<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

This is not beginner energy. It’s post-initiation. It’s the moment where someone has done enough inner work that they no longer swing between extremes, and that alone can deeply unsettle people who still do  


## 1. When you change, the system reacts
Most people exist inside quiet, unspoken agreements. Who stays agreeable. Who stays quiet. Who absorbs discomfort. When you step out of a role you used to play, even subtly, it destabilizes the system around you. People aren’t reacting to what you’re saying as much as the fact that you’re no longer predictable or containable. That alone can feel threatening to others, even if your words are calm and grounded.

## 2. Your boundaries expose unexamined places in others
When someone hasn’t done much inner work, clarity can feel like criticism. Your boundaries, your confidence, and your refusal to over-explain act like a mirror. People suddenly feel their own confusion, insecurity, or unresolved beliefs more sharply. Instead of sitting with that discomfort, many people externalize it. They argue. They poke. They challenge. Not because you’re wrong, but because you touched a place they haven’t looked at yet.

## 3. Silence used to protect them, not you
When you stayed quieter before, others could project whatever story they wanted onto you. Silence is comfortable for people who benefit from it. Once you speak, that comfort disappears. Now they have to reconcile their assumptions with reality. Some people respond to that by trying to pull you back into silence through debate, guilt, or friction.

## 4. Speaking clearly is mistaken for an invitation
A lot of people don’t know the difference between expression and engagement. You speaking your truth is read as “let’s discuss,” because they only know how to relate through argument or persuasion. To them, every statement is a negotiation. To you, some things are simply stated and settled. That mismatch alone creates conflict.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
## 5. You’re no longer available for emotional outsourcing
When someone hasn’t processed their own trauma or shadow material, they often look for places to discharge it. People who are grounded, reflective, and regulated can become targets for that discharge because they seem “strong enough to handle it.” That doesn’t mean it’s appropriate. It just means you’ve stopped being porous, and that makes some people uncomfortable.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
## 6. Losing people is a side effect, not a failure
When you say you don’t care how many friends you lose, that’s not apathy. That’s discernment. Relationships built on your silence, self minimization, or emotional labor cannot survive your alignment. That doesn’t mean you’re harsh or closed. It means you’re no longer willing to fracture yourself to keep peace that was never mutual.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
## 7. Why it feels like you’re “holding up a mirror”
You are. And mirrors don’t cause distortion, they reveal it. People who are doing their own work usually respond with curiosity, respect, or quiet reflection. People who aren’t often respond with defensiveness, projection, or attempts to destabilize you. The reaction tells you more about where they are than where you are.

The bottom line
You’re not here to argue. You’re not here to convince. You’re not here to carry other people’s unprocessed material. You’re here to live in integrity with yourself. When that integrity disrupts others, that’s information, not an assignment.
</blockquote>


And you’re right about one thing very clearly:
You’re not shooting anyone in the foot.
You’re just standing where you stand.
What they do with that is theirs.
