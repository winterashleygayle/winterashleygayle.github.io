# My Spirit Helper 
## A shamanic journey, a lighthouse, and a guide that appeared when I didn’t know I needed one.
### The Girl in the Lighthouse

Long ago, before I had language for it, I went on what they call a 'journey'.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

It took place to the rhythm of a drum, that steady heartbeat that loosens time and opens the thin veil between worlds. A woman named Anna guided the journey then. She no longer practices Shamanism, and I do not know where life carried her, but in that moment she was exactly who she needed to be: a witness, a holder of the doorway. I hope she is well.

In that journey, she followed me, but not as I am now. She followed my twelve-year-old self.

The girl ran barefoot along a beach, wind in her hair, eyes fixed on a lighthouse ahead. She ran with urgency and excitement, convinced that something extraordinary waited at the top. An alien, perhaps. An angel. Some ethereal being from the universe who would finally give her all the answers.

She burst through the lighthouse door and climbed the spiral stairs two at a time, heart racing, imagination blazing. At the top, she stopped short.

There was no celestial being waiting for her.
There was only a man.

An ordinary-looking man. Steady. Familiar.
He was the lighthouse keeper.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
As Anna described him, recognition landed in my body like a bell sounding in my chest. The man was my grandfather, not as I remembered him in photographs or family gatherings, but as something deeper. Younger. A version of him I had never met in waking life. A version of him that existed long before I was born. An ancestor in his proper element, tending the light.

He was carefully maintaining the lens, the intricate and fragile glass that fractures light into brilliance. He handled it with reverence, understanding that the lighthouse only works when every piece is honored, cleaned, and aligned. The light does not blaze by accident. It is crafted. Remembered. Passed down.

The girl felt disappointed. She had wanted the future, not the past. Technology, not history. She had never been particularly interested in what came before, only what was coming next.

He noticed.

Do not be so quick to dismiss history, he told her gently. Patterns matter. What came before you teaches you how to stand now.

What he was offering was not nostalgia. It was lineage, not only blood, but wisdom carried through generations. An understanding that spirit helpers do not always arrive as winged beings or visitors from the stars. Sometimes they arrive as ancestors who know the terrain because they walked it first.

Then he guided her outside, to the circular railing that wrapped the lighthouse.

Look, he said.
Below them, waves crashed against dark rocks.
You are never going to hit those, he told her calmly.
"You will never hit the rocks."
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
He turned then, not to the girl, but to Anna, the one witnessing and listening and answered the question forming in her mind.

Yes, he said. She is a lighthouse.
He gestured out to sea.

All those boats are other people, each on their own journey, each navigating storms, fog, and uncertainty.
The girl watched the distant lights bobbing on the water.

Your job is not to save them, he said. 
Not to chase them. 
Not to throw yourself into the sea.

He paused, letting the truth settle.
Your job is to stand where you are and shine.

Something clicked then. An old knowing resurfaced. The girl remembered words she had once read: Lighthouses do not run all over an island trying to rescue boats. They simply stand and shine.

She understood.
Guidance is not control. Help is not self-erasure. Presence is enough.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
Some ships would come close. Some would pass by. Some would resent the light or mistake it for judgment. Some would turn away, because seeing clearly can be uncomfortable. Guides are not always loved. They are not always chosen. You will be rejected and often. Sometimes they are only recognized later, when the shore is finally reached.

The mission was simple, and it was not easy.
Shine. Reflect. Hold steady.
And so he has stayed with her.

Since his passing, he returns not as a voice that interrupts, but as a presence that reassures, a tap on the shoulder, a gentle pat on the head, a reminder at just the right moment.

In his waking life, he signed every birthday card the same way:
Glad you made it.

In spirit, the message remains.
He was not only glad she reached the top of the lighthouse that day. He was glad she became it.

# Shamanic Journey
<div class="alchemy-symbol">△</div>
“Okay, but what is that, really?”

A shamanic journey is a guided, intentional inward experience, similar to meditation, visualization, or deep imagination, done while listening to steady rhythmic drumming.

The drumbeat is not symbolic or ceremonial for effect. It serves a practical purpose. A consistent rhythm, often around four to seven beats per second, helps the brain shift into a focused, dreamlike state similar to what happens just before sleep or during deep meditation. In this state, the mind becomes quieter and less analytical, allowing imagery, memory, and intuition to surface more naturally.

In practice, a person sits or lies down comfortably with their eyes closed while the drumbeat continues. There is no acting, pretending, or performing. The experience is observational. Images, scenes, emotions, or symbols may arise, or they may not. The focus is less on seeing something specific and more on listening inward in a different way.

The person guiding the journey is not sending anything into the experience or controlling it. Their role is to hold the rhythm, keep time, remain present, and act as a grounded witness. They are there much like someone sitting beside you while you think deeply, offering steadiness rather than direction. Their presence allows you to relax into the process without having to manage the container yourself.

From a modern psychological perspective, a shamanic journey can be understood as a guided imaginative process that accesses subconscious imagery and internal narrative. It operates in the same mental territory as active imagination, hypnagogic states, deep visualization, and narrative therapy. Nothing supernatural is required for the experience to be meaningful.

People use shamanic journeys to gain perspective, work through emotional material, access symbolic insight, reconnect with intuition, and create internal coherence. The meaning does not usually arrive during the journey itself, but afterward, through reflection on what emerged.

A simple way to explain it is this: it is a guided meditation that uses rhythm to help the mind access symbolic insight and intuition. No smoke, no costumes, no belief system required.
