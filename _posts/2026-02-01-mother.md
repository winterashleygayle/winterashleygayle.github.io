# My Mom
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

My mother died three days before Thanksgiving in 2017.
But in many ways, I felt like she had already been gone for years.

Not physically. Metaphorically. Spiritually. Something in her had begun to withdraw long before her body followed. I think the true turning point came around the time my brother died. The circumstances were complicated, painful, controversial, and toxic, and they fractured something in our family that never quite healed. After that, I did not really see my mother anymore. Even before that loss, there were years where she was present in name but unreachable in spirit. There was simply too much going on. Too much grief, too much mental decline, too many unspoken wounds.

Her health was failing. Her mental health had been unraveling for a long time. There were many factors that led to her death, but what I felt most strongly, even years before it happened, was that she was tired. I felt she was ready to go long before she actually did.

And yet, she stayed.

I believe now that one of the cords that anchored her here was her daughters. Her girls. She did not have the words to say it. Her mind did not have the capacity to articulate it. But her spirit lingered, watching, waiting, wanting to know that we would be okay.

My sister showed her that. Early on, she took control of her health and her life in ways that mattered. She stabilized. She grew. She proved, right in front of our mother’s eyes, that she was going to be okay. And she was. She went on to graduate college, to build a life, to stand on her own feet in a way that would have mattered deeply to our mom, whether she could say it or not.

For me, it took longer.

In the final weeks of my mother’s life, she had been in the hospital for over two weeks. I was exhausted. I stayed with her constantly, making sure she was not alone, making sure someone was there. At some point, the strain of it all became unbearable, not because I did not love her, but because I had already been grieving her for years.

On the day she died, as I drove to the hospital to spend another night with her, something in me broke open. I spoke to her out loud in the car.

I told her I was okay.
I told her I was going to be okay.
I told her that if she was waiting for me, she did not have to anymore.
That if she was tired, she could rest.
That it was okay to go.

When I arrived at the hospital, I had no service in the parking garage. I did not see the missed voicemails. I walked toward her room anyway. The nurses looked at me with a softness I recognized immediately. I knew before anyone said a word.

Her friend Linda was there. I looked at her and asked, “Is she gone?”
She said yes.

I collapsed right there on the floor, my backpack still on my shoulders, more in shock than grief. I had just been talking to her. I asked when she passed. Linda looked at the clock and said, “About 10 minutes ago.”

I glanced at the clock. It was 4:30. I had been speaking to her in the car at 4:20. I remember checking the time. 

She had gone in that in between space, after I told her she could leave and before I reached her room. I do not regret not being physically present when my mother died, because I was there. We were talking. We were together in the way that mattered.

After the shock settled in and I understood that she was gone, I took my backpack off and let it fall to the floor. Then I stood and looked at my mother. She was lying there, gone, her body still, her mouth slightly open. I felt something pass between us that did not need witnesses or explanation. I stood with my arms stretched out, as if holding an invisible current only we could feel. I looked at her and said out loud, my voice shaking, “Mom, it’s over!” When I said it, I covered my mouth with my hands, stunned by what I felt next.

The pain I had been carrying for her for years was gone. Not my grief, but the weight of watching her suffer. What remained was my own to carry, and that felt like relief. Not relief that she had died, but relief that her struggle had ended, and that I no longer had to witness it. 

She was gone.

## Death 

I believe that when someone is nearing death, there is still room for conversation. There is still room for permission. There is still room for love that does not require proximity. Death is not an ending. It is a transition. And sometimes the most loving thing you can do is tell someone that you will be okay without them, even if it breaks your heart to say it.

I needed space from my mother in life. Our relationship was complicated, painful, and often unhealthy. I used to joke that I needed two thousand lifetimes of distance just to breathe. But in death, she feels different. Quieter. Softer. She hovers now the way a mother might if she could finally let go of control and fear.

I do not talk to her often. I still need my space. But I feel her presence when I need it. Watchful, protective, finally gentle.

If you love someone who is close to dying, know this. You are allowed to speak to them. You are allowed to tell them you will be okay. You are allowed to ask them to stay with you in spirit while you continue living in a human body on this planet. Love does not end at death. It simply changes form.

Sometimes, letting someone go is not abandonment.
Sometimes, it is the last kindness.

# Her story
## fractured

There were parts of my mother’s life that were kept from me, and for a long time I did not know they existed at all.

When I was an infant, somewhere between five and six months old, my parents were abusing me and using drugs.  I had bruises all over my body and 14 stitches across my back. Some say it was my father Doug, but in my heart and gut, I feel it was her. Because of that, I was taken by Child Protective Services and placed with my aunt, where I lived for about a year. Eventually my mother proved to the courts that she could care for me, and I was returned to her. What I did not know then, and what was never clearly explained to me later, was that this year marked her recovery from drug addiction. It was a turning point in her life, but it was treated like a secret.

I grew up believing I had a mother who simply was. I did not know the cost it took for her to become that version of herself. I did not know what she had fought through. And because I did not know her history, I had no framework to understand what came later.

Years later, around the time I donated a kidney to her, a few years before my brother died, my mother relapsed. Her behavior became erratic, confusing, and frightening. To me, it felt sudden and inexplicable. I did not understand why my mother would choose drugs. I did not understand why she would unravel in this way. No one sat me down and told me the truth. No one gave me the context. I was left to make sense of chaos without a map.

It was by accident that I learned the truth. While my mother was dying in the hospital, I was asked by my uncle what all the friction between her and I was all about. I told him the truth. My Mom was using heroin with my brother and sister. He casually said "Everybody knows Mitzi has always been a drug addict." I remember looking at him and saying, very plainly, that I did not know that. That moment changed everything. I felt stupid. Completly blind and left in the dark. Suddenly, what I thought was a sudden decision was revealed to be a relapse. What I thought was random was actually part of a lifelong struggle.

But the damage had already been done.
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

For years, I carried shock and anger. I thought I had a peerless mother one day, and then suddenly I did not. I judged her through a lens that had no compassion because it had no information. I believed she had simply chosen drugs over healing. I believed she had taken something from me and never tried to make herself better. I did not understand relapse. I did not understand addiction as a disease of the nervous system, of trauma, of unhealed childhood wounds.

Learning the truth changed my understanding of the human condition.

Relapse taught me that healing is not linear. That pain does not expire. That coping mechanisms are formed early and often carried for life unless consciously healed. My mother carried wounds she never truly addressed. Not because she was incapable of love, but because she lacked language. She did not grow up in a time where inner child work, nervous system healing, or trauma informed care were part of the conversation.

And still, grace does not mean absolution.

She was given chances. Second, third, fourth chances. She was offered help. At some point, choices were made. And those choices were hers. They were not caused by me. They were not a reflection of my worth or my lovability. They were the result of her own unresolved pain.

Part of my healing has been learning to hold both truths at once.

I can understand her without excusing her.
I can grieve her wounds without carrying responsibility for them.
I can release blame without denying reality.

I did not follow her path. I did not become addicted to drugs or alcohol. My coping mechanisms leaned in other directions. Codependence. Overthinking. Hyper vigilance. Emotional labor. Different strategies, same attempt to survive pain. And I am mindful of that. I pay attention. I choose awareness where she could not or would not.

It has taken years to let my anger move through me fully before writing from this place. I needed to let the rage burn itself out so that what remained was clarity. Understanding. Grounded truth. Not forgiveness as performance, but acceptance as reality.

What I know now is this.

My mother’s addiction was not my fault.
Her relapse was not my failure.
Her choices were not a verdict on my value.

She was a woman shaped by pain who did not heal it in time. I am a daughter shaped by truth who chose differently. And that difference matters.

This is not a story of blame. It is a story of context. And context changes everything.

## The Mother Wound
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

The mother wound is not always about cruelty or abandonment. Often, it is about absence that exists inside presence. It is the ache of having a mother who was physically there but emotionally unreachable. A mother who loved deeply, but did not have the inner resources to offer safety, attunement, or consistency. For many daughters, the wound does not come from what was done, but from what could not be given.

For some daughters, the mother wound is not only about emotional absence or misattunement. It is also shaped by abuse that was real, embodied, and frightening. Abuse does not exist only in words or moods. It can live in the body through physical harm, intimidation, or the constant threat of it.

Physical abuse teaches a child that safety is conditional. The body learns to anticipate pain, to flinch, to brace. Even when the violence is not constant, the unpredictability itself becomes the injury. A daughter learns that love and danger can exist in the same space, and this confusion follows her into adulthood.

Emotional abuse often accompanies physical abuse. It may show up as humiliation, shaming, control, or emotional withdrawal. A child may be told she is difficult, ungrateful, or responsible for the parent’s distress. Over time, the daughter internalizes the belief that her needs provoke harm, and that silence or compliance equals safety.

Emotional incest adds another layer of distortion. It occurs when a mother relies on her daughter for emotional support that should come from another adult. The daughter becomes a confidant, mediator, caretaker, or emotional anchor. There may be no sexual violation, yet the emotional boundaries are crossed. The child’s inner world becomes occupied by the parent’s pain.

When physical abuse, emotional abuse, and emotional incest intersect, the daughter is placed in an impossible position. She is expected to soothe the person who harms her. She is asked to stay close to what frightens her. She may feel loyalty, fear, love, and resentment all at once, without language to separate them. 

In my own life, my mother was full of rage. She did unspeakabale things to me that I will not be discussing here out of respect for my nervous system. 

As far as my mother, she did not disappear all at once. She slowly withdrew long before her body failed. Her mental health declined. Grief reshaped her. Loss hollowed out parts of her that never fully returned. I learned, over time, that loving her meant learning how to live without being mothered in the way I needed. That is one of the most painful lessons a daughter can carry.

Daughters who experience the mother wound often grow up learning how to self regulate too early. They become intuitive, watchful, and emotionally advanced beyond their years. They learn how to read rooms, manage tension, and anticipate the needs of others. At the same time, they often struggle to identify their own needs or believe they are worthy of care. They may carry guilt for wanting distance and shame for wanting closeness. Love becomes something they earn rather than something they receive.

In families shaped by trauma, addiction, mental illness, or unresolved grief, daughters are often asked to adapt instead of being protected. They may feel responsible for their mother’s wellbeing. They may sense that their stability is the thread holding everything together. In my own experience, I felt that my mother stayed alive not because she was well, but because she needed to know her daughters would survive without her. That kind of emotional responsibility leaves a deep imprint.

The mother wound often shows up later in life through relationships. Daughters may over give, over explain, or over tolerate. They may struggle with boundaries or feel unsafe when things are calm. They may crave closeness but feel overwhelmed by it. They may fear becoming their mother while also fearing being abandoned like they once felt. This inner conflict can live quietly for years, shaping choices, patterns, and self perception.

Healing the mother wound does not require rewriting the past or turning a mother into a villain. It begins with telling the truth. Naming what was missing. Allowing grief for the mother you needed but did not have. This grief is not betrayal. It is an act of self respect.

Healing also means releasing the belief that it was your job to save her, fix her, or stay small so she could cope. Daughters are not meant to parent their parents. When you let go of that responsibility, you begin to reclaim your own life force.

One of the most powerful moments of healing for me came when I gave my mother permission to go. In that moment, I was also giving myself permission to live. I was no longer tethered to waiting, rescuing, or proving that I would be okay. I chose myself without abandoning love. That is the quiet alchemy of healing the mother wound.

Healing looks like learning how to mother yourself in the ways you were not mothered. Creating safety in your body. Offering yourself compassion without justification. Building boundaries that protect your nervous system. Allowing rest without guilt. Letting relationships be reciprocal instead of transactional.

It also looks like redefining what connection means after loss. Some daughters feel their mothers more clearly after death, not because the relationship was resolved, but because the pressure is gone. Love can exist without obligation. Presence can exist without harm. That, too, is a form of healing.

The mother wound does not disappear. It softens. It becomes integrated wisdom rather than an open ache. Daughters who do this work often become deeply empathetic, grounded, and self aware. They learn how to hold complexity. They learn how to love without self erasure.

Healing the mother wound is not about forgiveness on a timeline or closure in a neat package. It is about choosing truth, compassion, and self protection at the same time. It is about honoring the mother who did her best and the daughter who deserved more. Both can exist. And when they do, something inside finally rests.
