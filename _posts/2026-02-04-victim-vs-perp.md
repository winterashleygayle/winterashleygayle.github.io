# A Deeper Frame
## Ideology as a Byproduct of Trauma, Not Its Cause

Political ideology is often treated as if it emerges from rational thought, moral reasoning, or cultural alignment. From a psychological and trauma informed perspective, however, ideology more often functions as a defense structure. It is a meaning making system built around how a person learned to survive power, threat, safety, and belonging.

At the deepest level, many ideological positions are not really about ideas at all. They are about how power was first experienced in the body.

This framing moves the discussion away from left versus right and toward something far more foundational: victim based versus perpetrator based nervous system organization.

## Victim and Perpetrator as Nervous System Positions

A critical distinction that is often lost in public discourse is this: victim and perpetrator are not moral identities. They are adaptive nervous system positions.

A victim organized nervous system often learns early that safety depends on appeasement, invisibility, or compliance. Power is experienced as external and dangerous. Speaking up, resisting, or asserting oneself may lead to punishment, withdrawal of love, or abandonment.

A perpetrator organized nervous system, by contrast, learns that safety comes from dominance, control, or certainty. Vulnerability is equated with weakness. Power must be seized, maintained, or enforced in order to prevent chaos, humiliation, or loss of status.

These adaptations often originate in childhood, but they do not require overt abuse to form. Emotional neglect, chronic invalidation, inconsistent caregiving, rigid belief systems, or authoritarian family dynamics can all shape these patterns. This is why not all abused children become perpetrators, and not all perpetrators were abused. Genetics, temperament, timing, and relational context all play a role. It truly is a roll of the dice, but the dice are heavily weighted by early experience.

## Evil as the Refusal of Responsibility

One of the most enduring contributions of People of the Lie is its refusal to define evil as monstrous or rare. Instead, evil is described as the active refusal to acknowledge one’s own destructiveness.

From a trauma perspective, this reflects a collapse of self reflection in favor of image management. These individuals are not necessarily sadistic. More often, they are rigid, morally absolutist, intolerant of ambiguity, and deeply invested in being right rather than being truthful.

Seen through a victim perpetrator lens, this maps closely onto perpetrator identified defenses. Projection allows aggression to be located in others. Moralization frames domination as righteousness. Dehumanization reduces people to symbols, threats, or abstractions rather than full human beings.

## When Victims Become Perpetrator Type Victims

One of the most subtle and difficult dynamics to name is the phenomenon of perpetrator type victims. These are individuals who identify with victimhood not as a condition to be healed, but as an identity to be defended.

Such individuals may use moral injury as leverage, police others’ speech, thoughts, or autonomy, and derive meaning from grievance rather than agency. Psychologically, this is not true empowerment. It is a lateral shift into perpetration, often justified as justice, safety, or accountability.

From a trauma lens, the original victim never fully regains sovereignty. Power is reclaimed not internally through agency and self regulation, but externally through control. The nervous system remains organized around threat. In this way, victimhood can become self perpetuating and can unintentionally strip sovereignty from others, keeping everyone locked in reactive roles.

## Why Ideology Becomes Intoxicating

Ideological systems are compelling because they offer certainty where the nervous system feels chaos, moral clarity where internal conflict exists, and belonging without requiring deep relational repair.

For someone with a victim organized nervous system, ideology may promise protection, recognition, and external validation of pain. For someone with a perpetrator organized nervous system, ideology may promise authority, justification, and a sanctioned outlet for aggression.

This is why the same ideology can attract vastly different psychological profiles. It is also why ideological debates so often feel futile. People are not arguing ideas. They are defending survival maps.

## Childhood as the Foundational Setpoint

When these patterns begin in childhood, they do not feel like patterns. They feel like reality.

A child does not think, “I am adapting to an unsafe environment.” The body simply learns, “This is how the world works.”

That learning becomes the nervous system’s baseline. What feels normal. What feels threatening. What feels true.

Undoing this later in life requires enormous self awareness, relational safety, and often somatic or trauma informed work. This is why simply telling someone to take responsibility or stop being a victim is ineffective and often retraumatizing. The nervous system cannot release what it has not yet learned is no longer necessary.

## Sovereignty as the Real Divide

At the deepest level, the true psychological divide is not political. It is the divide between sovereignty and control.

Sovereignty means recognizing responsibility for one’s inner world, no longer needing to dominate or collapse in order to feel safe, and being able to hold complexity without annihilating oneself or others.

Control, whether expressed through victim or perpetrator posture, means safety must be enforced externally, other people must change for me to be okay, and ambiguity feels intolerable.

Healing, both individually and collectively, involves moving beyond both victim and perpetrator identities and into agency without domination.

## The Quiet Truth Beneath It All

Most people are not evil. Most people are not weak. Most people are simply unaware of the nervous system stories they are living inside of.

Ideology becomes dangerous not when people care deeply, but when it is used to avoid self reflection, externalize responsibility, and legitimize the removal of others’ sovereignty.

This is why People of the Lie remains painfully relevant, not as a political text, but as a warning about what happens when trauma, certainty, and moral superiority fuse.
