# A Deeper Frame
## Ideology as a Byproduct of Trauma, Not Its Cause

Political ideology is often treated as the product of rational thought, moral reasoning, or cultural alignment. People are assumed to arrive at their beliefs through logic, values, or careful consideration of evidence. From a psychological and trauma informed perspective, however, ideology more often functions as something else entirely. It operates as a defense structure. A meaning making system built around how a person learned to survive power, threat, safety, and belonging.

At its deepest level, ideology is rarely about ideas alone. It is about how power was first experienced in the body.

This framing moves the conversation away from left versus right and toward something far more foundational. It asks us to consider the difference between victim organized and perpetrator organized nervous systems. Not as moral categories, but as adaptive survival patterns.

## Victim and Perpetrator as Nervous System Positions

One of the most important distinctions often lost in public discourse is this: victim and perpetrator are not identities. They are nervous system positions shaped by experience.

A victim organized nervous system often forms in environments where safety depended on appeasement, invisibility, or compliance. Power was experienced as external and dangerous. Speaking up, resisting, or asserting oneself carried the risk of punishment, withdrawal of love, humiliation, or abandonment. The body learned that survival required staying small, agreeable, or unseen.

A perpetrator organized nervous system develops differently. In these environments, safety is associated with dominance, control, or certainty. Vulnerability becomes synonymous with weakness. Power must be seized, maintained, or enforced in order to prevent chaos, loss of status, or emotional annihilation. The nervous system learns that control equals safety.

These adaptations often originate in childhood, but they do not require overt abuse to form. Emotional neglect, chronic invalidation, inconsistent caregiving, rigid belief systems, or authoritarian family dynamics can all shape these patterns. This is why not all abused children become perpetrators, and not all perpetrators were abused. Genetics, temperament, timing, and relational context all matter. It is, in many ways, a roll of the dice. But the dice are heavily weighted by early experience.

## Evil as the Refusal of Responsibility

One of the most enduring insights from People of the Lie is its refusal to define evil as monstrous or rare. Instead, evil is described as the active refusal to acknowledge one’s own destructiveness.

From a trauma perspective, this reflects a collapse of self reflection in favor of image management. These individuals are not necessarily sadistic. More often, they are rigid, morally absolutist, intolerant of ambiguity, and deeply invested in being right rather than being truthful.

Seen through a victim perpetrator lens, this aligns closely with perpetrator organized defenses. Projection allows aggression to be located in others. Moralization reframes domination as righteousness. Dehumanization reduces people to symbols, threats, or abstractions rather than full human beings. Responsibility is continually displaced outward, preserving a sense of internal innocence at any cost.

## When Victims Become Perpetrator Type Victims

One of the most subtle and difficult dynamics to name is the phenomenon of perpetrator type victims. These are individuals who identify with victimhood not as a condition to be healed, but as an identity to be defended.

In these cases, moral injury becomes leverage. Language is policed. Dissent is framed as harm. Others’ autonomy is constrained in the name of safety, justice, or accountability. Psychologically, this is not true empowerment. It is a lateral shift into perpetration, often justified through moral reasoning.

From a trauma informed lens, the original victim never fully regains sovereignty. Power is reclaimed externally through control rather than internally through agency and self regulation. The nervous system remains organized around threat. In this way, victimhood becomes self perpetuating and can quietly strip sovereignty from others, keeping everyone locked into reactive roles.

## Why Ideology Becomes Intoxicating

Ideological systems are compelling because they offer certainty where the nervous system feels chaos, moral clarity where internal conflict exists, and belonging without requiring deep relational repair.

For someone with a victim organized nervous system, ideology may promise protection, recognition, and external validation of pain. For someone with a perpetrator organized nervous system, ideology may promise authority, justification, and a sanctioned outlet for aggression.

This is why the same ideology can attract vastly different psychological profiles. It is also why ideological debates so often feel futile. People are not defending ideas. They are defending survival maps.

## Childhood as the Foundational Set Point

When these patterns begin in childhood, they do not feel like patterns. They feel like reality.

A child does not think, “I am adapting to an unsafe environment.” The body simply learns, “This is how the world works.”

That learning becomes the nervous system’s baseline. What feels normal. What feels threatening. What feels true.

Undoing this later in life requires extraordinary self awareness, relational safety, and often somatic or trauma informed work. This is why telling someone to simply take responsibility or stop being a victim is ineffective and often retraumatizing. The nervous system cannot release what it has not yet learned is no longer necessary.

## Sovereignty as the Real Divide

At the deepest level, the true psychological divide is not political. It is the divide between sovereignty and control.

Sovereignty involves responsibility for one’s inner world, the ability to tolerate ambiguity, and the capacity to remain grounded without dominating or collapsing. Control, whether expressed through victim or perpetrator posture, insists that safety must be enforced externally and that other people must change for the self to feel secure.

Healing, both individually and collectively, requires moving beyond both victim and perpetrator identities and into agency without domination.

The Quiet Truth Beneath It All

Most people are not evil. Most people are not weak. Most people are simply unaware of the nervous system stories they are living inside of.

Ideology becomes dangerous not when people care deeply, but when it is used to avoid self reflection, externalize responsibility, and legitimize the removal of others’ sovereignty.

This is why People of the Lie remains painfully relevant, not as a political text, but as a warning. A warning about what happens when trauma, certainty, and moral superiority fuse.
