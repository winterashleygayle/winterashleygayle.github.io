# The Devil Inside 
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>


The devil did not arrive with red skin or horns or the sound of hooves on the floor.

He did not announce himself.

He came quietly, like an atmosphere. Like something that settles into a house and changes the air without anyone noticing right away. He came as confusion. As exhaustion. As the slow erosion of clarity. He came as an energy that does not destroy all at once, but steals a little vitality here, a little imagination there until what remains is a body still breathing but no longer fully inhabited.

That is how the devil took my family.
Not through spectacle. Through attrition.

I was the last to know.

## The Silence Around Addiction

My mother died three days before Thanksgiving in 2017. But in many ways, she had already been gone for years.

Not physically. Spiritually.

Something in her withdrew long before her body followed. I felt it, even when I did not yet understand it. She was present in name, but unreachable in essence. Conversations went nowhere. Emotions flattened or exploded without warning. There was too much grief, too much mental decline, too many unspoken truths crowding the room.

What I did not know, what no one told me, was that my mother was a recovering drug addict long before I was born. That she had relapsed. That heroin had re entered her life quietly, decisively, and without ceremony.

I did not grow up with context. I grew up with confusion.

When a child is denied context, she blames herself for chaos she cannot explain.

I judged my mother through a lens that had no compassion because it had no information. I thought she had chosen drugs over healing, chosen destruction over love, chosen something over me. I did not understand relapse. I did not understand addiction as a nervous system disease, a trauma response, a survival pattern that can reassert itself decades later when grief cracks old foundations.

The truth arrived late, and by accident.

While my mother was dying in the hospital, an uncle casually said, “Everyone knows she’s always been a drug addict.”

Everyone knew.

Except me.

That moment fractured something fundamental. Not just my understanding of my mother, but my understanding of how families protect themselves by keeping the most vulnerable person in the dark.

## The Devil as Theft

Addiction is not chaos in the way people imagine it. It is not always wild or reckless. Often, it is quiet. Methodical. It drains creativity, agency, and imagination until a person’s inner life collapses into obsession, paranoia, or despair.

This is why I say the devil took my family.

Not because I believe in a literal demon, but because I believe in forces that hollow people out. Forces that turn living, creative beings into shells organized around craving, fear, and survival.

My siblings fell into it.

My sister survived a coma that shut down her organs. My brother did not survive his pain. He died by suicide, and the circumstances around his death were complicated, controversial, and deeply destabilizing. His death shattered whatever fragile equilibrium remained in our family system.

After that, my mother disappeared completely.

Grief broke something in her that never healed.

Being the One Who Stayed Awake

I did not follow them.

That does not mean I escaped unscathed.

My coping mechanisms leaned in other directions: hypervigilance, over responsibility, emotional labor, codependence. Different strategies. Same attempt to survive unbearable pain.

I became the watcher. The regulator. The one who stayed lucid in a system unraveling around me.

There is a particular loneliness in being the one who stays awake while everyone else disappears into their demons. You are expected to understand without being understood. To forgive without being apologized to. To remain functional while everything meaningful collapses.

The devil did not take me. But he took everything around me, and that has its own cost.

## Letting My Mother Go

In the final weeks of my mother’s life, I stayed with her constantly. She had been in the hospital for over two weeks. I was exhausted in a way that goes beyond sleep deprivation. I had been grieving her for years already.

On the day she died, driving to the hospital, something in me broke open.

I spoke to her out loud.

I told her I was okay. I told her she didn’t have to stay for me anymore. That if she was tired, she could rest. That she could go.

When I arrived, she had passed ten minutes earlier between the moment I spoke to her in the car and the moment I reached her room.

I do not regret not being physically present when she died. We were together in the way that mattered.

When I stood beside her body, I felt something release. Not my grief, but the burden of carrying her suffering for her. That weight fell away. What remained was mine alone, and that felt like relief.

Sometimes letting someone go is not abandonment.

Sometimes it is the last mercy.

## Holding Two Truths

Understanding addiction does not absolve harm.

My mother was shaped by pain she never healed, but she still made choices. She was offered help. She was given chances. At some point, responsibility belongs to the person making them.

Part of my healing has been learning to hold two truths at once:

I can understand her without excusing her.
I can grieve her wounds without carrying them.
I can release blame without denying reality.

Her addiction was not my fault. Her relapse was not my failure. Her choices were not a verdict on my worth.

### What Remains

</p>

The devil took my family but not my clarity.

Not my voice.
Not my capacity to see.
Not my creative force.

If anything, surviving this stripped me down to something essential. I know now how insidious destruction can be when it wears the mask of normalcy. I know how easily pain replicates itself when left unnamed. I know how vital context is not to excuse harm, but to understand it.

This is not a story about evil as spectacle.

It is a story about what happens when pain is left unhealed long enough to consume everyone it touches.

And it is also a story about refusal.

Refusal to disappear.
Refusal to numb.
Refusal to hand my life force over to the same darkness that swallowed the rest.

The devil may have taken my family.

But he did not take me.
