### The Devil Inside 
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>


The devil did not arrive with red skin or horns or the sound of hooves on the floor.

He did not announce himself.

He came quietly, like an atmosphere. Like something that settles into a house and changes the air without anyone noticing right away. He came as confusion. As exhaustion. As the slow erosion of clarity. He came as an energy that does not destroy all at once, but steals a little vitality here, a little imagination there until what remains is a body still breathing but no longer fully inhabited.

That is how the devil took my family.
Not through spectacle. Through attrition.

I was the last to know.

## The Silence Around Addiction

My mother died three days before Thanksgiving in 2017. But in many ways, she had already been gone for years.

Not physically. Spiritually.

Something in her withdrew long before her body followed. I felt it, even when I did not yet understand it. She was present in name, but unreachable in essence. Conversations went nowhere. Emotions flattened or exploded without warning. There was too much grief, too much mental decline, too many unspoken truths crowding the room.

What I did not know, what no one told me, was that my mother was in recovery from drug addiction when I was an infant. I did not know what substances were involved at that time. Years later, she relapsed, and heroin entered her life during that period.

I did not grow up with context. I grew up with confusion.

When a child is denied context, she blames herself for chaos she cannot explain.

I judged my mother through a lens that had no compassion because it had no information. I thought she had chosen drugs over healing, chosen destruction over love, chosen something over me. I did not understand relapse. I did not understand addiction as a nervous system disease, a trauma response, a survival pattern that can reassert itself decades later when grief cracks old foundations.

The truth arrived late, and by accident.

While my mother was dying in the hospital, an uncle casually said, “Everyone knows she’s always been a drug addict.”

Everyone knew.

Except me.

That moment fractured something fundamental. Not just my understanding of my mother, but my understanding of how families protect themselves by keeping the most vulnerable person in the dark.

## The Devil as Theft

Addiction is not chaos in the way people imagine it. It is not always wild or reckless. Often, it is quiet. Methodical. It drains creativity, agency, and imagination until a person’s inner life collapses into obsession, paranoia, or despair.

This is why I say the devil took my family.

Not because I believe in a literal demon, but because I believe in forces that hollow people out. Forces that turn living, creative beings into shells organized around craving, fear, and survival.

My siblings fell into it.

My sister survived a coma that shut down her organs. My brother did not survive his pain. He died by suicide, and the circumstances around his death were complicated, controversial, and deeply destabilizing. His death shattered whatever fragile equilibrium remained in our family system.

After that, my mother withdrew almost entirely. She was grieving, but she was also in deep denial about the role she had played in the situation that unfolded.

## Being the One Who Stayed Awake

I did not follow them.

That does not mean I escaped unscathed.

My coping mechanisms leaned in other directions: hypervigilance, over responsibility, emotional labor, codependence. Different strategies. Same attempt to survive unbearable pain.

I became the watcher. The regulator. It felt like being awake inside a lucid nightmare, aware of what was happening but unable to control it. The one who stayed lucid in a system unraveling around me. 

There is a particular loneliness in being the one who stays awake while everyone else disappears into their demons. You are expected to understand without being understood. To forgive without being apologized to. To remain functional while everything meaningful collapses.

The devil did not take me. 
But he took everything around me, and that has its own cost.

## Letting My Mother Go

In the final weeks of my mother’s life, I stayed with her constantly. She had been in the hospital for over two weeks. I was exhausted in a way that goes beyond sleep deprivation. I had been grieving her for years already.

On the day she died, driving to the hospital, something in me broke open.

I spoke to her out loud.

I told her I was okay. I told her she didn’t have to stay for me anymore. That if she was tired, she could rest. That she could go.

When I arrived, she had passed ten minutes earlier between the moment I spoke to her in the car and the moment I reached her room.

I do not regret not being physically present when she died. We were together in the way that mattered.

When I stood beside her body, I felt something release. Not my grief, but the burden of carrying her suffering for her. That weight fell away. What remained was mine alone, and that felt like relief.

Sometimes letting someone go is not abandonment.

Sometimes it is the last mercy.

## Holding Two Truths

Understanding addiction does not absolve harm.

My mother was shaped by pain she never healed, but she still made choices. She was offered help. She was given chances. At some point, responsibility belongs to the person making them.

Part of my healing has been learning to hold two truths at once:

I can understand her without excusing her.
I can grieve her wounds without carrying them.
I can release blame without denying reality.

Her addiction was not my fault. Her relapse was not my failure. Her choices were not a verdict on my worth.

## The One Who Was Not Taken

As a spiritual person, I have often struggled to find language for something I experience without turning it into fantasy or self mythology. What I know is this: whatever moved through my family did not move through me in the same way.

For a long time, I described this in spiritual terms. It felt as though I was insulated from something dense and corrosive, as though whatever force hollowed out the people I loved could not penetrate me. That sense of insulation did not feel like superiority or immunity. It felt costly. Like standing awake in the middle of a fire that burns everything else.

In moments of grief, my mind reached for myth. I imagined something ancient and enraged, furious at its own limits, unable to consume me directly and instead circling outward, dismantling what I loved. Not as punishment, but as consequence. As a kind of displaced violence. I wondered whether this was simply a child’s imagination searching for meaning, turning pain into story because story is how humans survive the unbearable.

But when I strip away the mythic language, what remains is something surprisingly scientific.

Trauma does not distribute itself evenly. Addiction does not move randomly. These forces tend to take hold where nervous systems are already overwhelmed, dissociated, or organized around survival rather than integration. What spared me was not divine favoritism. It was pattern interruption.

I stayed conscious.

While others numbed, fragmented, or collapsed inward, my nervous system adapted toward vigilance and coherence. Hypervigilance is not protection in itself, but it does preserve awareness. Awareness is what addiction and self destruction require most to be absent. You cannot steal life force from someone who remains present to it.

From a neurobiological perspective, resilience is not the absence of pain. It is the ability to metabolize it without dissociation. My family’s pain moved underground. Mine stayed awake.

Spiritual language gave me a way to name this before science ever could. I felt surrounded, protected, held in moments when everything around me was unraveling. Whether one calls that angels, God, intuition, or an internalized secure attachment does not change the function. Something kept me from collapsing into the same fate.

There were moments when I felt an unmistakable instruction to pause. To step back. To stay out of the line of fire. Not grand revelations, not booming voices, just quiet signals that said wait, sit, do not enter this terrain. From a psychological lens, this may have been my nervous system recognizing danger and choosing self preservation. From a spiritual lens, it felt like protection.

Perhaps it does not matter which is true.

What matters is that I listened.

Being the one who survives carries its own weight. When everyone else falls, survival does not feel like victory. It feels like responsibility. It feels like guilt. Not the kind rooted in wrongdoing, but the kind that comes from witnessing. The kind that asks why me and not them.

In spiritual traditions, this is sometimes framed as karma. In psychology, it is called survivor’s guilt. Both point to the same truth. Awareness has a cost. Consciousness carries burden. Knowing means you cannot look away.

My family lived out their pain in their bodies. I carried mine in my mind.

That is not a moral distinction. It is a nervous system outcome.

Your mind is your karma in the sense that whatever remains conscious must be carried, integrated, and transformed. What is numbed repeats. What is seen has the chance to end.

If there is a force beneath this story, it is not a devil and it is not a god at war. It is entropy versus integration. Collapse versus coherence. Dissociation versus presence.

What took my family was not rage. It was disconnection.

What spared me was not holiness. It was staying awake.

And that, too, has a price.

## Your Mind is your Karma

There is another truth that sits alongside this, one that is harder to say without sounding mystical, yet feels accurate in my body.

Sometimes the mind being your karma is not a punishment. It is a gift.

It is as if some part of you arrives already knowing what paths not to take. Not because you are wiser or better, but because the cost of those paths has already been paid somewhere, sometime. Whether one believes this comes from past lives, inherited trauma, epigenetics, or early nervous system imprinting does not change the outcome. The knowing is there at the moment of birth.

You shy away from certain forms of destruction even when they would make life easier in the short term. Even when numbing would offer relief. Even when collapse would be understandable. You feel the edge of those exits and turn away, not out of virtue, but out of recognition.

This does not mean you are spared from suffering.
It means you are spared from the kinds of suffering that erases awareness.

You are still here for lessons. Hard ones. Lonely ones. Lessons that require endurance rather than escape. Lessons that demand staying present inside pain rather than outrunning it. There is nothing easy about this path. Having a sound mind does not protect you from grief, loss, or devastation. It only ensures that you will feel them fully.

But that soundness is what allows survival.

Not survival as mere continuation, but survival with coherence. With memory. With meaning. With the capacity to integrate what happened rather than be consumed by it.

In families touched by addiction, mental illness, and unhealed trauma, this kind of awareness can feel isolating. It separates you from the exits everyone else takes. It leaves you standing in the aftermath, holding the truth that no one else could bear to hold.

If the devil took my family, then perhaps this was the counterforce. Not divine intervention. Not moral superiority. But a mind that could not be taken offline.

A mind that knew, from the beginning, what it must refuse in order to remain intact.

And that, too, is a form of inheritance.

### What Remains

</p>

The devil took my family but not my clarity.

Not my voice.
Not my capacity to see.
Not my creative force.

If anything, surviving this stripped me down to something essential. I know now how insidious destruction can be when it wears the mask of normalcy. I know how easily pain replicates itself when left unnamed. I know how vital context is not to excuse harm, but to understand it.

This is not a story about evil as spectacle.

It is a story about what happens when pain is left unhealed long enough to consume everyone it touches.

And it is also a story about refusal.

Refusal to disappear.
Refusal to numb.
Refusal to hand my life force over to the same darkness that swallowed the rest.

The devil may have taken my family.

But he did not take me.
