## When Goodness Becomes a Threat
<div class="alchemy-symbol">△</div>

<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>

I was once described as having what someone called 'retard strength.' It was delivered like a joke, wrapped in a thin layer of admiration, but it was mostly a putdown. The kind of insult disguised as humor. The implication was not just that I was strong, but that I was somehow too dense to feel the sting of it. As if the joke would not land because I would not register it. As if the label fit precisely because it was assumed I would not be bothered.

That is the cruelty of it.

It reduces strength to something crude. It strips resilience of intelligence. It turns endurance into something primitive. The comment was less about my physical capacity and more about diminishing my awareness. Strong, yes, but supposedly unaware. Capable, but not perceptive. Powerful, but not refined enough to notice the insult hidden inside the compliment.

What lingers is not the word itself, but the assumption beneath it. That I could carry more than expected and somehow not feel more than expected. That I could absorb impact without it registering. That my tolerance meant I lacked depth. But tolerance is not ignorance. And strength is not stupidity. I could lift more than expected. Carry more than expected. Endure more than expected. The phrase lingered. It's meaning meant I was an idiot.

Dostoevsky’s Prince Myshkin returns to Russian society after years in Switzerland recovering from epilepsy. He is open. He is guileless. He speaks honestly. He assumes sincerity in others. He does not play social games. He does not manipulate. He does not posture. He sees suffering and responds with compassion instead of calculation.

This line refers to The Idiot, a novel written by Fyodor Dostoevsky and first published in 1869.

In the novel, the central character is Prince Lev Myshkin, a young Russian nobleman who returns to St. Petersburg society after spending several years in Switzerland receiving treatment for epilepsy. His illness is important not only medically, but symbolically. Myshkin’s seizures and heightened sensitivity reflect his extreme emotional openness and spiritual intensity.

When he reenters Russian high society, he encounters a world driven by pride, ambition, romantic obsession, social hierarchy, and manipulation. Unlike those around him, Myshkin is radically honest, compassionate, and transparent. He assumes sincerity in others. He does not strategize socially. He does not protect himself through ego performance.

Because of this, he is repeatedly called an 'idiot.'
Not because he is intellectually impaired. In fact he is perceptive. What makes him dangerous is that he does not participate in the invisible contracts of ego and dominance that structure the society around him. He exposes people simply by being unguarded. His goodness reveals their fragmentation.

Modern readers often misunderstand the novel. It is not about stupidity. It is about what happens when Christ like compassion walks into a room governed by pride, lust, power, and insecurity. Dostoevsky himself described the novel as an attempt to portray a perfectly beautiful human being placed in a corrupt world. The tragedy is not that Myshkin is weak. The tragedy is that the world does not know how to metabolize purity.

That is where the crossover begins.

At other times I felt like Cinderella, not the softened fairy tale version, but the older archetype. The woman in the ashes. The one who keeps the structure intact while others take credit for the beauty of the house. The one whose labor is invisible because it is constant. The one whose worth is measured in how much she can manage without complaint. Efficient and unnoticed. Essential and unnamed. A presence only recognized when she stops performing.

And then there is the role that has followed me into adulthood. The Useful Idiot. The stabilizer of systems that do not nourish her. The one whose empathy is quietly extracted to maintain emotional economies that are not reciprocal. The one who believes she is building connection while others are benefiting from her loyalty. The one who assumes sincerity in rooms where strategy is the native language.

<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
I was born into a system where love was conditional and emotional labor was currency. An extremely narcissistic mother does not raise a child. She recruits one. The child becomes an emotional regulator, a confidant, a stabilizer. I learned early that safety came from attunement. I learned to read moods before words were spoken. I learned that if I could soothe, anticipate, and adjust, I could maintain connection.

It is a powerful skill.

It is also a blueprint.

Because when attunement becomes identity, you begin to attract those who prefer to be centered. Manipulative personalities do not seek equals. They seek stabilizers. They seek empathy without boundary. They seek someone who believes the best of them long after the evidence suggests otherwise.

Prince Myshkin walks into salons filled with status games and romantic intrigue. He responds to cruelty with kindness. He forgives betrayal. He believes confessions. The more transparent he is, the more destabilizing he becomes to those around him. His sincerity disrupts their manipulations. And so they oscillate between idolizing him and mocking him.

I recognize that rhythm.

<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
In relationships, I have often become the useful one. The steady one. The emotionally literate one. In a same sex relationship, I was unconsciously cast into an energetic role that did not fit my full self. I could never quite decode what was expected. I felt that I was both too much and not enough. My femininity was inconvenient. My difference was destabilizing. The moment I stopped shape shifting, the fracture appeared.

In friendships, I provide comfort and depth. I hold space. I validate. But when I introduce divergence, when I express my own needs or perspective, the energy shifts. Sometimes it explodes. Sometimes it dissolves quietly. The pattern is familiar. When I stop being useful, I stop being safe to them.

The painful question is not why they behaved as they did. The painful question is why I remained.

This is where the word idiot becomes spiritually provocative.

In Russian spiritual tradition there exists the concept of the holy fool. A person who appears foolish to the world because they refuse to conform to its corruptions. Their innocence is not ignorance. It is refusal. They see clearly, yet they choose love over cynicism. They do not harden.

But there is a shadow side. When innocence has not yet integrated discernment, it becomes exploitable. When compassion is not paired with boundary, it becomes self abandonment.

The modern world does not persecute goodness overtly. It tests it. It pokes at it. It seduces it. It manipulates it. And when goodness does not submit to control, it labels it naive.

Why is goodness threatening?

Because manipulation requires distortion. It requires secrecy. It requires subtle dominance. A genuinely kind person disrupts that field. They do not respond predictably to coercion. They do not escalate in ego games. They mirror without trying. They ask sincere questions. They forgive without losing clarity. This unsettles those whose identities are constructed around power.

Prince Myshkin does not destroy anyone. He simply stands in contrast to them. And that contrast is unbearable.

I have begun to see that what I once labeled as my flaw may actually be my unfinished initiation. The part of me that believes people are fundamentally good is not wrong. It is incomplete. It needs discernment. It needs timing. It needs the ability to withdraw access without withdrawing love.

Spiritually, this feels like a rite of passage. The Fool in tarot is not the fool of mockery. The Fool is zero. The beginning. The one who steps forward without armor. But the mature Fool is not reckless. She walks consciously. She knows there is a cliff, yet she trusts her intuition rather than the noise of the crowd.

In psychological terms, leaving the caretaker role feels like stepping off that cliff. If I am not needed, who am I. If I am not the stabilizer, what remains. There is grief in that question. There is loneliness in sovereignty. But there is also freedom.

Dostoevsky did not allow Myshkin to triumph. The novel ends in tragedy. His purity cannot survive unchanged in that environment. But that does not mean purity is weak. It means it must be integrated with strength.

The lesson is not to become cynical. The lesson is to become discerning without becoming closed.

Goodness in the modern world is often perceived as a threat because it exposes the architecture of manipulation. When you refuse to perform a role assigned to you, those who benefited from that role experience destabilization. They may call you naive. They may call you dramatic. They may withdraw. But what they are actually confronting is the loss of access.

I am beginning to understand that I was never the idiot. I was the one who assumed reciprocity in asymmetrical relationships. I was the one who mistook intensity for intimacy. I was the one who believed that explaining myself would produce understanding in someone committed to misunderstanding.

That is not stupidity. That is uncalibrated hope.

The spiritual evolution is not about losing hope. It is about refining it. Offering it where it can land. Withdrawing it where it is consumed.

Modern goodness must be sovereign. It must be paired with boundaries. It must be able to say no without rage. It must be able to walk away without collapse. It must trust the first flicker of intuition instead of overriding it in the name of empathy.

In that sense, The Idiot is not a warning against innocence. It is a study of innocence without protection. And perhaps my journey is the sequel. Innocence with discernment. Compassion with spine. Femininity without performance. Love without self erasure.

If the world calls that foolish, so be it.

But I am no longer interested in being useful.

I am interested in being whole.
