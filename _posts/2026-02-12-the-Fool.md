Dostoevsky’s Prince Myshkin returns to Russian society after years in Switzerland recovering from epilepsy. He is open. He is guileless. He speaks honestly. He assumes sincerity in others. He does not play social games. He does not manipulate. He does not posture. He sees suffering and responds with compassion instead of calculation.

For this, he is called an idiot.

Not because he is intellectually impaired. In fact he is perceptive. What makes him dangerous is that he does not participate in the invisible contracts of ego and dominance that structure the society around him. He exposes people simply by being unguarded. His goodness reveals their fragmentation.

Modern readers often misunderstand the novel. It is not about stupidity. It is about what happens when Christ like compassion walks into a room governed by pride, lust, power, and insecurity. Dostoevsky himself described the novel as an attempt to portray a perfectly beautiful human being placed in a corrupt world. The tragedy is not that Myshkin is weak. The tragedy is that the world does not know how to metabolize purity.

That is where the crossover begins.

I was born into a system where love was conditional and emotional labor was currency. An extremely narcissistic mother does not raise a child. She recruits one. The child becomes an emotional regulator, a confidant, a stabilizer. I learned early that safety came from attunement. I learned to read moods before words were spoken. I learned that if I could soothe, anticipate, and adjust, I could maintain connection.

It is a powerful skill.

It is also a blueprint.

Because when attunement becomes identity, you begin to attract those who prefer to be centered. Manipulative personalities do not seek equals. They seek stabilizers. They seek empathy without boundary. They seek someone who believes the best of them long after the evidence suggests otherwise.

Prince Myshkin walks into salons filled with status games and romantic intrigue. He responds to cruelty with kindness. He forgives betrayal. He believes confessions. The more transparent he is, the more destabilizing he becomes to those around him. His sincerity disrupts their manipulations. And so they oscillate between idolizing him and mocking him.

I recognize that rhythm.

In relationships, I have often become the useful one. The steady one. The emotionally literate one. In a same sex relationship, I was unconsciously cast into an energetic role that did not fit my full self. I could never quite decode what was expected. I felt that I was both too much and not enough. My femininity was inconvenient. My difference was destabilizing. The moment I stopped shape shifting, the fracture appeared.

In friendships, I provide comfort and depth. I hold space. I validate. But when I introduce divergence, when I express my own needs or perspective, the energy shifts. Sometimes it explodes. Sometimes it dissolves quietly. The pattern is familiar. When I stop being useful, I stop being safe to them.
