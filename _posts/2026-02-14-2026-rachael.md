## The Children We Don’t Get to Keep

### The Temporary Mother
### On Loving a Child for a Season and Letting Her Go

There’s a kind of heartbreak no one names.

It’s not losing the partner.

It’s losing the child who was never technically yours.

For two years of my life, I loved a little girl between the ages of three and five. I was not her mother. I never tried to be. But love does not ask for paperwork before it roots itself.

We built something small and steady.

After-school snacks.
Cartoons on the couch.
Princess dresses in every possible color because she wanted to be every single princess.
Barbies spread across the living room floor while I sat nearby, just watching her be little.

I stayed in my lane. I let her mother parent. I loved gently within the boundaries that existed.

I adored that part most, watching her simply exist in girlhood. No self-consciousness. No performance. Just imagination and glitter and absolute certainty that she could be anything.

I put her on the school bus her first day of kindergarten. I remember the way the bus felt too big for her small body. I remember the backpack straps. The way she climbed those steps like it was both terrifying and thrilling. I remember standing there after it drove away, feeling strangely proud and strangely protective at the same time.

At bath time, I would sing Bob Marley to her.

“Baby, don’t worry about a thing…
‘Cause every little thing is gonna be alright.”

She would lean back in the warm water and let me sing it over her. I don’t know if she remembers that song attached to my voice. I hope somewhere in her nervous system it still means calm.

At night, sometimes we would all be on the couch or lying in bed, her mother in the middle, me on one side. She would snuggle into her mom, but she would reach across her mother’s stomach and chest to touch my arm. Just her small hand stretching across to make sure I was still there.

It was in those moments I felt so deeply loved it almost hurt.

She didn’t have to reach for me.
But she did.

And I will never forget that.

When I would come home from work, she would run out to the sidewalk to greet me, pure excitement written all over her face. Her mother would smile the same way. There was something so wholehearted about those welcomes, so uncomplicated. I wish I had soaked those moments in more deeply. 

I was carrying a weight back then, wrapped in a kind of depression that made everything feel slightly underwater. I tried so hard to be present, but something unseen was anchoring me down. I know now what that anchor was, and I have since swum to the bottom of that ocean to untie it from myself. Still, hindsight has a way of softening memory. Some seasons in life make you wish for a quiet do-over, or just one more chance to stand in a doorway and let the love fully land, to feel it settle in your chest and say, clearly, how much it meant.

When the relationship ended, I didn’t just lose a partner. I was quietly removed from a child’s daily life.

There’s no ceremony for that.
No structured goodbye.
No closure conversation at eye level.
No reconciliation for being silently erased from a child’s existence. 

No handbook on how to grieve someone who is still alive, still growing, just no longer allowed to reach for you.

The last time I saw her regularly she was nine. Now she’s fifteen.

Six years at that age is an entire lifetime.

I ran into her once at a grocery store. She had her stepdad with her. She ran up to me and hugged me without hesitation. Children don’t fake that.

I asked her if she knew my last name.

She said no.

And I told her, “It’s Winter. Like Frozen. Ashley Winter.”

I knew I would probably get in trouble for that. I knew it might be seen as overstepping. But I wanted her to know my name. Just in case. In twenty or thirty years, if she ever needed to look me up. If something in her life ever felt unstable and she needed another steady adult from her childhood.

I never planned to insert myself.

I just wanted the door to exist.

Maybe that was my own projection. Maybe that was my inner child wanting to be the adult I once needed, the one you could track down later to say, “You mattered. You helped. You were pivotal.”

I had people like that when I was young. Adults who showed up quietly and shaped me without knowing it. Later in life, I wished I could find them and tell them how much their presence meant.

I think part of me wanted to be that for someone.

Even if I’m not now.

She has a mother. A father. A stepfather. Siblings. She appears well cared for. I don’t carry a savior narrative about her life. I don’t imagine she is incomplete without me.



Sometimes I see her in public. She glances past me as if I am a stranger. Maybe I am now. Maybe that’s what survival looks like for a child navigating adult fallout. Maybe that’s just adolescence.

I don’t try to insert myself into her narrative. I don’t need to be important in her story.

But I know I mattered once.

And this is the part people don’t talk about:

When adults rupture, children absorb.

I don’t know what she was told. I don’t know what she believes about me. I don’t know if she remembers the warm towels or the afternoons that felt safe.

What I do know is this:

I was good to her.
And she was good for me.

She let me practice steady love without chaos attached to it. She let me mother in a way that wasn’t rooted in fear or survival. In loving her, something in me softened.

Losing her did not make me bitter.

It made me aware of how temporary some sacred things are.

There is an archetype that doesn’t get much attention, the temporary mother. The stepmother without the fairy tale villain narrative. The woman who loves a child for a season and then must disappear without explanation.

We talk about attachment in psychology. We talk about ambiguous loss. We talk about trauma bonds between adults.

But we don’t talk enough about this:

The grief of loving someone you have no legal claim to.
The grief of being erased from a child’s daily life.
The quiet ache of knowing you were once part of their nervous system’s sense of safety.

This isn’t about possession.

It’s about rupture.

It’s about the part of me that still hopes she remembers that she was loved well in those years.

Some children aren’t ours to keep.

They are ours to love for a season.

And sometimes the most adult thing we can do is bless them silently from a distance.

Even when our heart still stings.

But I do hold this truth:

For a season, I was part of her world.
And she was part of mine.

The ache isn’t ownership.
It isn’t entitlement.

It’s the quiet grief of loving well and then being erased from the daily rhythm of someone’s becoming.

## And Now? 

Some roles in our lives are not permanent assignments. They are initiations.

I was allowed to mother without possessing. To love without claiming. To show up fully while knowing the ground beneath me was temporary.

Maybe the measure of love isn’t how long we stay. Maybe it’s how gently we held someone while we were there.

If she never looks me up, that doesn’t erase what was real.

If she never remembers my name, that doesn’t undo the warmth of a towel fresh from the dryer or a song sung over bathwater.

I was there.
I loved her well.
And that matters.

Questions to Sit With

Have you ever loved someone you were never meant to keep?

Who were the quiet adults in your childhood who shaped you without claiming you?

And if you were a temporary presence in someone’s life, what would you hope they carry forward from you?
