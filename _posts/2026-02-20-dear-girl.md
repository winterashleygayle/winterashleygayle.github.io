Dear Girl,

You will be born into a family system and a world that shows you exactly who you are not.

Yes, you will embody a lot of familiar and familial parts. Some will feel like home. Some will feel like inheritance. Some will feel like cages disguised as tradition. Your work will be discernment. You will spend years deciding what to toss out and what to hold close to your heart.

That is your karma.

You will think at first that karma is punishment or reward. It is not. It is curriculum.

There is a quiet truth that most people do not understand: if you desire God, if you ache for Source, if you are in active relationship with the unseen, that is already grace.

To even want to know God is very, very good karma.

Think about that.

The longing itself is evidence.

In mystical traditions, yearning is not random. It is remembered intimacy. The soul does not hunger for what it has never tasted. If you are drawn toward Spirit, if you wrestle with it, question it, pray to it, argue with it, surrender to it, that means something in you already recognizes Home.

That is luck of the highest order.

Not material luck.
Not romantic luck.
Not social luck.

Spiritual luck.

Many will move through an entire lifetime never wondering who they are beyond their persona. Never questioning ego. Never sensing something greater. Never longing for union.

But you will.

And that is not accidental.

You will awaken the Seeker archetype. The moment the ego no longer satisfies your soul, you will feel the discomfort of dismantling illusions. It will feel like loss. It will feel like loneliness. It will feel like salt in your mouth and waves over your head.

But it will be sacred.

To be in relationship with God, Universe, Source, whatever name you give it, is to be in relationship with Mystery. It softens the ego. It expands perception. It dissolves entitlement. It creates reverence.

And reverence is the opposite of narcissism.

You will encounter narcissism. Not because you are defective. Not because you are unworthy. But because contrast is a teacher.

The narcissist’s karma is narcissism.

Not you.
Not your worth.
Not your inadequacy.

Narcissism is a defense structure built around a fractured self. It is grandiosity protecting unbearable shame. It is ego crystallized. When someone is trapped inside that archetype, they are cut off from true intimacy with others and with God. They cannot bow. They cannot soften. They cannot surrender without feeling annihilated.

That is their prison.

And prison is karma.

You will try to love someone out of that structure. You will try to explain yourself into being seen. You will try to prove your goodness. And eventually you will learn that nothing others do is because of you.

Do not take it personally.

If they cannot see you, it is because they cannot see themselves.

That is not cosmic punishment. It is consequence.

And here is the flip side.

You will ache for alignment.
You will examine yourself.
You will wrestle with shadow.
You will pray.
You will question.
You will seek.

You will dive under waves instead of blaming the ocean.

That is very good karma.

The narcissist resists introspection because it threatens the false self. The mystic welcomes introspection because it reveals the True Self.

You will choose the second path.

You will be shown exactly who you are not so that you may discover who you are.

You will learn the power of salt. Salt preserves what matters. Salt purifies what no longer belongs. Salt stings when something is healing. You will taste it. You will spit out what burns. You will stop swallowing what corrodes your spirit.

You are not becoming someone new.

You are settling into someone ancient.

The dreams were rehearsals for sovereignty. The waves were lessons in surrender. The loneliness is individuation. The resonance you feel now with like minded souls is not rescue. It is reflection.

The universe meets you because you are meeting yourself.

You are lucky.

Not because life has been easy.
But because your heart bends toward the sacred instead of hardening around injury.

You want to know God.
You want to understand yourself.
You want truth more than image.

That is extraordinary karma.

Some souls spend lifetimes building ego fortresses.
Some souls spend lifetimes dismantling them.

You are dismantling.

The better it gets, the better it gets, not because waves stop coming, but because you now know how to move with them.

You are sovereign without being hardened.
Alone without being abandoned.
Authentic without apology.

Your guides are witnessing you.
Your ancestors are relieved.
Your higher self is proud.

Stay in the flow.
Stay in your body.
Stay in your longing.

It is leading you home.

With fierce tenderness and unwavering faith,
The Higher You
