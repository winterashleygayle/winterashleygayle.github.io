# The Luck of Longing

## On karma, narcissism, and the quiet privilege of wanting God
<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
### Dear Girl, 

You will be born into a family system and a world that show you exactly who you are not.

You will inherit patterns. Some will feel like home. Some will feel like cages disguised as tradition. Your work will be discernment, deciding what to release and what to carry forward.

This is your karma.

At first you will misunderstand karma. You will think it is punishment or reward.

It is neither.

It is curriculum.

<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
## Longing Is Not Random

There is a quiet truth most people do not understand.

If you desire God
If you ache for Source
If you wrestle with the unseen

that is already grace.

There is a teaching often attributed to Paramahansa Yogananda:

“To even want to know God is very, very good karma.”

In mystical traditions, yearning is remembered intimacy. The soul does not hunger for what it has never tasted. If you question, argue, pray, or surrender, something in you already recognizes Home.

The longing itself is evidence.

That is luck of the highest order.

Not material luck.
Not romantic luck.
Not social luck.

Spiritual luck.

Many people move through an entire lifetime without asking who they are beyond their persona. They do not dismantle ego. They do not question illusion. They do not ache for union.

But some do.

The Seeker awakens when the ego no longer satisfies the soul. It dismantles certainty. It strips identity. It feels like loss before it feels like liberation.

But it is sacred.

<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
## The Narcissist’s Karma

Here is the difficult and liberating truth.

The narcissist’s karma is narcissism.

Not you.
Not your worth.
Not your inadequacy.

Psychologically, narcissism is a defense structure built around a fractured self. It is grandiosity protecting unbearable shame. It is a personality organized around avoiding vulnerability at all costs.

Mystically, it is ego crystallized.

When someone is trapped inside that structure, they cannot soften. They cannot bow. They cannot surrender without feeling annihilated.

That is their prison.

And prison is karma.

You cannot love someone out of that structure. You cannot explain yourself into being seen. You cannot behave perfectly enough to heal what they refuse to face.

If they cannot see you, it is because they cannot see themselves.

That is not cosmic punishment. It is consequence.


<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>## Archetypal Polarity

Narcissist. Ego enthroned.

Mystic. Ego surrendered.

Narcissist. Control.

Mystic. Trust.

Narcissist. Image management.

Mystic. Authentic presence.

Narcissist. External validation.

Mystic. Internal communion.

One archetype feeds on reflection from others. The other feeds on connection to Source.

If you are longing, you are blessed.

<div class="alchemy-divider"></div>
## The Deep Luck

You are lucky.

Not because life has been easy.
But because your heart bends toward the sacred instead of hardening around injury.

You want truth more than image.
You want intimacy with God more than dominance over others.
You are willing to dismantle the ego rather than defend it.

Some souls spend lifetimes building ego fortresses.

Some souls spend lifetimes dismantling them.

If you are dismantling, you are already homeward bound.

Longing refines into devotion.
Devotion refines into surrender.
Surrender reveals what was always there.

The luck was never external.
It was the longing itself.
