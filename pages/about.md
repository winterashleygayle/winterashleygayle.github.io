# About

Ashley Winter is a photographer and storyteller from Eugene, Oregon, whose work explores the intersection of nature, memory, and transformation. Born in Texas and raised in Alaska and California, she is deeply influenced by the raw stillness of the wilderness. Her imagery reflects impermanence, resilience, and the quiet beauty found in natural forms, capturing how light transforms ordinary moments into reflections of spirit and presence. Through photography, Ashley examines the relationship between nature and the human experience, finding balance between strength and softness, solitude and connection. Her lived experience as a survivor and advocate for self-awareness and healing informs her creative lens, allowing her to translate emotional truth into visual form. Each piece invites reflection on the unseen conversation between spirit and matter, and on how beauty continues to emerge through time and loss.
